    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Over the course of the past three years, I have been actively engaged in the fields of data science and artificial intelligence. I have spent half of this duration developing machine learning solutions for the finance and tourism sectors, and the other half focused on the game industry. During this time, I also successfully completed a master degree, which has further equipped me with a solid understanding of the underlying principles and techniques of these fields. My expertise is grounded in statistics and machine learning, and encompasses a range of skills including working with large and complex datasets, designing and executing AB tests, building predictive models, and conducting statistical analysis. My experience in these areas has been honed through my involvement in various projects across different domains. As of April 2023, I have taken up the role of Senior Data Scientist at Zynga, where I am applying my knowledge and skills to develop and deliver innovative solutions in the realm of data science and artificial intelligence.</p>
