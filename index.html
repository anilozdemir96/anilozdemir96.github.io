    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Over the course of the past three years, I have been actively engaged in the fields of data science and artificial intelligence. I have spent half of this duration developing machine learning solutions for the finance and tourism sectors, and the other half focused on the game industry. During this time, I also successfully completed a master degree, which has further equipped me with a solid understanding of the underlying principles and techniques of these fields. My expertise is grounded in statistics and machine learning, and encompasses a range of skills including working with large and complex datasets, designing and executing AB tests, building predictive models, and conducting statistical analysis. My experience in these areas has been honed through my involvement in various projects across different domains. As of April 2023, I have taken up the role of Senior Data Scientist at Zynga, where I am applying my knowledge and skills to develop and deliver innovative solutions in the realm of data science and artificial intelligence.</p>

      <h4>Senior AI & NLP Engineer - Seturtech</h4>
      <p>I have experience in developing cutting-edge artificial intelligence and natural language processing
solutions for the purpose of evaluating user experience in the tourism industry. Specifically, my work
includes the creation of a distributed, bidirectional, cross-reputation, and aspect-based review service
for hotels and tourism-related entities. This solution can be utilized across multiple countries. My work
in this field includes conducting morphological and dependency analysis, sequence tagging, parser
development, aspect-based categorization, and cross-reputation analysis</p>

      <h4>Document Recommendation using Graph Representation Learning - Master Thesis, Supervisor: Prof. Selim Balcisoy, Dr. Onur Varol , Dr. Reyyan Yeniterzi.</h4>
      <p>We introduced novel document recommendation system and visual exploratory tool that utilizes a
combination of natural language processing algorithms and graph representation learning methods.
The system leverages conjoined n-grams, temporal information, and additional meta-data to create a
heterogeneous graph network representation, effectively solving the cold-start problem</p>
